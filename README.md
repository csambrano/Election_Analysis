A Colorado Board of Elections employee gave me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. 

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote. 
6. Calculate the voter turnout for each county.
7. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
8. Determine the county with the highest turnout.

## Election Audit Overview
The purpose of this election analysis audit is to provide additional data to the election commission to complete the audit. The requested data includes voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout.

# Election-Audit Summary
The script can be used for any types of election by modification. For example, we can use this for school elections. The script would need to be updated to see which grades of students had the highest voting turnout rather than county. It can also be used for a presidential election, in which counties will need to be updated to states. We could also add a for-loop to analyze voter turn out for each political party.
